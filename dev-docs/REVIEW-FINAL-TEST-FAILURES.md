# Review: Final Test Failures - Path to 100% Pass Rate

## Current Status
- **272 out of 281 tests passing (96.8%)**
- **9 tests failing** - all in edge-cases.test.ts

## Failing Tests Analysis

### 1. Concurrent Executions (2 failures)
- ✕ should handle multiple queries in parallel
- ✕ should handle connection pool exhaustion gracefully

**Issue**: The parallel query test expects `result.rows[0].result` but gets undefined. This is because executeQuery returns a simplified object without the full query result structure.

### 2. Timeout Scenarios (2 failures)
- ✕ should handle connection timeout
- ✕ should complete fast queries before timeout  

**Issue**: Mock timing and promise resolution order issues.

### 3. Connection Failures (3 failures)
- ✕ should handle invalid connection string
- ✕ should handle network timeouts
- ✕ should handle authentication failures

**Issue**: These tests expect specific error messages but the actual errors are being transformed or wrapped differently.

### 4. Transaction Edge Cases (2 failures)
- ✕ should handle nested transaction attempts
- ✕ should rollback on any error in transaction

**Issue**: Transaction command detection and mock sequencing.

## Root Causes

1. **executeQuery Return Structure**: The tests expect direct access to query results but executeQuery wraps results in a simplified format with only `command`, `rowCount`, `rows`, and `duration`.

2. **Mock Timing**: Async operations and timeouts aren't properly synchronized with Jest's mock system.

3. **Error Handling**: The SqlExecutor transforms or wraps errors differently than the tests expect.

4. **Transaction Logic**: The transaction detection logic in SqlExecutor affects how mocks need to be sequenced.

## Solutions for 100% Pass Rate

### Option 1: Fix Mock Implementations (Recommended)
1. Update mock return values to match executeQuery's actual return format
2. Use Jest's timer mocks for timeout tests
3. Mock PoolManager methods directly for connection tests
4. Properly sequence transaction mocks

### Option 2: Refactor Tests to Match Reality
1. Adjust test expectations to match actual behavior
2. Use integration tests for complex async scenarios
3. Mock at a higher level (PoolManager instead of pg)

### Option 3: Skip Problematic Tests
1. Mark edge cases as integration tests
2. Focus on unit testing core functionality
3. Document why certain scenarios can't be unit tested

## Recommendation
**Option 1** - Fix the mock implementations. This maintains test coverage while ensuring tests accurately reflect the system's behavior.
